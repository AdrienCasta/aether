# 🌬️ Aether — explore your inner patterns

_Aether_ is a self-reflection tool that helps you record fragments of life — emotions, thoughts, events — and discover the hidden patterns behind them.  
By logging what you experience, Aether brings awareness to your internal loops, mental triggers, and recurring behaviors.

## 🌌 Why "Aether"?

In ancient philosophy, **aether** (also spelled _ether_) was believed to be the fifth element — the invisible substance that filled the universe beyond the material.  
In this app, **Aether** represents the subtle patterns that float beneath the surface of your daily experience — the invisible yet real connections between your emotions, habits, and thoughts.

## 🧠 What is Aether?

Aether is **a personal system for insight generation**.  
You don’t track goals or tasks. You track **fragments of life** — and let the system surface meaning:

- ✍️ Note anything you feel, think, or live through (no pressure, no judgment)
- 🔁 Detect recurring loops, triggers, or emotional spirals
- 🧬 Understand what causes what, over time
- 🎯 Set personal experiments (“what if I change this one thing?”)
- 📊 Watch patterns evolve — or dissolve

Aether is like a **weather report for your inner world**.

## 🧱 How does it work?

1. **Fragment logging**  
   You write short entries about what you experience — thoughts, feelings, situations.

2. **Pattern detection**  
   The app looks for recurring themes, loops, correlations in time, tags, or emotions.

3. **Insights generation**  
   Based on the patterns, Aether suggests possible causes, effects, and points of reflection.

4. **Evolution over time**  
   You can track whether a pattern strengthens, fades, or transforms.
